# TODO App

This is a simple TODO application built as part of a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) to improve my skills in **Tailwind CSS** and **Angular**.

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed or not completed
- Filter tasks by status (All / Active / Completed)
- Responsive design (mobile & desktop)
- Dark mode toggle

## Purpose

The main goal of this project was to practice working with Tailwind and Angular by implementing a fully functional, clean and responsive TODO app based on a Frontend Mentor challenge.

Feel free to explore and modify the project!
